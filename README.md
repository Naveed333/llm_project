# IngrEdibles

A Streamlit-powered web app that lets you snap or upload a photo of vegetables (or type them in), detects the ingredients via CLIP, and generates full recipes using a quantized LLM from Hugging Face. Free users get a general recipe; paid subscribers unlock personalized recipes (spice level, cuisine, cook time, dietary goals).
