**Dish Name:** "Aromatic Sunset"

**Preparation & Cooking Time:** 45 minutes

**Ingredients:**

*   2 large onions, thinly sliced
*   4 cloves garlic, minced
*   ½ cup dry white wine (such as Pinot Grigio)
*   1 tablespoon olive oil
*   ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes (adjust to taste)
*   8 ounces (about 2 cups) fresh mozzarella, torn into pieces
*   Fresh basil leaves, chopped
*   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
*   Grill (optional, but highly recommended)

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1.  Prepare the Onion Base: In a large skillet or grill pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and cook, stirring frequently, until they are softened and caramelized – about 20-25 minutes. This will take patience!
2.  Infuse with Aroma: Add the minced garlic to the skillet with the onions and cook for another 2 minutes, being careful not to burn it.
3.  Deglaze with Wine: Pour in the white wine and let it simmer for 2-3 minutes, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.
4.  Add Heat and Finish: Stir in the red pepper flakes and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cook for an additional 5 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.
5.  Assemble the Dish: Gently fold in the torn mozzarella and fresh basil leaves. Arrange on a platter.

**Serving Suggestions:**

Serve immediately. Garnish with extra fresh basil and a sprinkle of flaky sea salt.
